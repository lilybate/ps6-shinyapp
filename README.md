# ps6-shinyapp" User Documentation

Link to the app on shinyapps.io server: https://lily-bates.shinyapps.io/PS6_LilyB/

This app has three tabs, opening, graph, and table. 

### Opening
This tab has a brief explination of the data and a random sample of 5 lines of the data set. As is seen in the sample, the data set contains tempature measurements of different regions around the globe. Regions can we identified in the region column. The date of the sample is divided into month and year of sample, and the tempature measurement shows the deviation of the measurement from the 2020 baseline (wether it was hotter or colder.) 

### Graph
The graph plots the tempature measurement against the year. You can use the widget to selelect which month you would want to see, and how that month compared to other months in different years. You can also choose if you want to veiw a trendline with the data you selected, and the text below the graph shows how many total measurements you are looking at in the graph. 

### Table
The table splits up measurement by region and shows the absolute largest and smallest tempature measurement for that region over all the years recorded. By selecting multiple regions, you can compare the min and max tempature observations for each region. The text also informs you how many total observations are being evaluated when pulling the min and max values.
